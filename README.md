# LungCapacityTestingDevice

The MEMS 1041 - Mechanical Measurements I course included a final project where students designed and tested affordable testing devices capable of measuring a patient's lung capacity.

This repository includes calibration and data collection scripts that our group wrote in MatLab to facilitate the use of our testing device. Also included are MatLab figures of the results of our calibration process and examples of test data collected with our device.
